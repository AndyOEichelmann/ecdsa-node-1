## ECDSA Node

Thise proyect is using the "ethereum-cryptography" dependency version 2.0.0

For my solution fo the proyect ther are major changes in the "server/index.js" and "client/src/Wallet.jsx" files. Also ther are some minor changes in the "client/src/App.jsx" and "client/src/Transfer.jsx". All the changes made have a brief coment referencin what they acomplishe.

Ther is also a script folder in the server folder containing a text file (server/scripts/acounts.tx) with the relevante information of the registered acounts and a generator (server/scripts/generate.js) code that creates info for new acounts.
